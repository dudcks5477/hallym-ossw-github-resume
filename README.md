# MY Resume
## I'm Young Chan Kim
Hello! I'm YoungChan Kim who dreams of becoming a Program Manager. I like to plan, and I like to make something new. "Let's explore a new path rather than going back the way we came." I like to go back to the way I came and try new things by creating a new path rather than regretting it.
